Minesweep

Make sure you have node and git installed.
To play, do the following:

```git clone https://github.com/javieranselmi/minesweep.git```

```cd minesweep```

```npm install```

```node app```

Access the frontend through a browser in http://localhost:7210. 
I tried it in Chrome, but should work for other browsers as well (don't you IE 7.0 me).

## NOTE:

 I haven't had the time to do the following:
 
 Win\Lose acnowledgement.
 
 Flagging a mine.
 
 Inputs in the frontend for choosing the width and length (you can change it in the public/app.js file, it works.
 
 Showing time left in frontend and possibility of losing by time.
 
 Request parameter validation.
 
 Function parameter validations and null checks all over the API, and logging.
 
Using models and better organized code in the frontend, I put too much effort in the API and had to rush-code through the frontend.
